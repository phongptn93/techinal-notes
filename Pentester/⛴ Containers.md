A `container` cannot be defined as a virtual machine but as an isolated group of `processes` running on a single host that corresponds to a complete application, including its configuration and dependencies. This application is packaged in a precisely defined and reusable format. Unlike a usual VM on VMware Workstation, however, a container does not contain its operating system or kernel. It is, therefore, not a virtualized operating system. For this reason, containers are significantly slimmer than conventional virtual machines. Precisely because they are not real virtual machines, they are also referred to as application virtualization in this context.

## [What Is Container Technology](https://dev.azure.com/Industrial-nois/FASF/_git/Backend-Fresh-Z?anchor=what-is-container-technology)

- Container technology is a method of packaging and deploying applications in a way that isolates them from the underlying infrastructure and operating system. Containers allow developers to package an application and its dependencies into a single, self-contained unit that can be easily transferred and run on any compatible platform.
    
- Containers are implemented using a technology called containerization, which involves creating a lightweight, standalone, executable package that contains everything an application needs to run, including code, libraries, system tools, and runtime. This makes it easier to deploy and manage applications, as they can be run consistently across different environments without the need to install and configure dependencies separately.
    
- Containers are typically used in conjunction with container orchestration tools, which allow developers to manage and deploy multiple containers as a single unit. This makes it easier to scale and manage large, complex applications that are composed of multiple interconnected containers.
    
- Some popular container technologies include Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenShift. These tools provide a platform-agnostic way to package and deploy applications, making it easier to develop and deploy applications in a consistent manner across different environments.
